#ecom-website 
This is an ecommerce website. It has pretty styling from the beautiful light colours for an asthetic oriented furniture website.

#Motivation
I created this simple website for fun. I needed to get excited over the simple changes that are possible with some css. The main purpose is to get better at CSS as I continue to practice.

#How to use?
Simply clone the website on github. Using either git commands or clicking Fork. Then include the project in a folder of your choice. Thereafter make any changes you desire in css or add functionality.
Lastly enjoy exploring your css skills.
